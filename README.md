## Introduction

Airbnb is an online platform that allows people to rent out their properties or rooms short-term to guests from around the world. Since its inception, it has revolutionized the hospitality industry by offering an alternative to traditional hotels and providing an additional source of income for hosts.

This project aims to conduct a thorough analysis of Airbnb data to identify investment opportunities. Through this analysis, we aim to better understand market trends, the factors influencing property success, and the areas with the highest potential for profitability.

To achieve this objective, we will use data provided by Airbnb, which will undergo an extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) process to ensure its integrity and quality. Subsequently, an exploratory data analysis (EDA) will be conducted using Python to uncover patterns, relationships, and key characteristics of the data.

The analysis will focus on several aspects, such as the geographic distribution of properties, prices, occupancy, guest ratings, and other relevant factors that may influence investment decisions. The results will be presented clearly and concisely to facilitate understanding and support informed decision-making.

## Descriptive Analysis

- **Description of Airbnb Business**: Through the datasets, we can observe the distribution of prices, occupancy, and reviews of the properties.
- **Best Ways to Invest**: Properties with high demand and good profitability were identified, recommending investments in properties with specific characteristics such as location and type of housing.
- **Comparison with Other Investments**: Airbnb offers a competitive investment alternative, with potential high returns due to the growing demand for short-term rentals.

## Investment Recommendations

- **Location**: It is recommended to invest in urban areas with high tourist demand.
- **Type of Property**: Small and well-located properties tend to perform better.
- **Investment Strategies**: Consider diversifying in different locations and types of properties to mitigate risks.

## Technology Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Power BI

## Resources Used

- **calendar.csv**: Includes occupancy, price, etc.
- **listings.csv**: Details of each listing operation, including descriptive data of the property (rooms, host, minimum and maximum nights, number of reviews).
- **reviews.csv**: User review data.

## EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

The exploratory data analysis was conducted in a Python notebook, documenting each step clearly and drawing corresponding conclusions in each used graph. Highlights include the search for missing values, outliers, and duplicate records, as well as the use of coherent graphs according to the type of variable.

## Dashboard

A functional and coherent dashboard was designed with the project's storytelling. The dashboard includes filters that allow detailed exploration of the data, facilitating information interpretation and analysis interactively.

## Repository Elements

- **EDA.ipynb**: Exploratory data analysis.
- **Dashboard.pbix**: Dashboard designed for presenting this work.
